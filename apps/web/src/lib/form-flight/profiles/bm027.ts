/**
 * AUTO-GENERATED SKELETON — NOT FIDELITY COMPLETE.
 *
 * Source: QLLAW_DOCX_FIDELITY_SOURCE_EXTRACT.latest.json + locked
 * contract `docs\audit\docx\contracts\locked\BM-027__7c207d24faee.contract.locked.json`.
 *
 * This file is a skeleton, NOT a runtime-ready profile. It is
 * discovered by the Form Flight inventory tooling but is ignored by
 * both adapters (`template-runtime-adapter`,
 * `generated-document-adapter`) because:
 *
 *   - `runtimeReady` is false (or omitted).
 *   - `profileStatus` is "skeleton".
 *
 * `isRuntimeReadyProfile` is fail-closed: a profile that does not
 * match `runtimeReady === true && profileStatus === "runtime-ready"`
 * is treated as "no profile" by the shared core. So this skeleton
 * cannot affect the runtime template lifecycle or the generated-
 * document lifecycle.
 *
 * What is provided here (safe, auto-generated):
 *   - fieldPaths           (locked contract fields, alphabetically sorted)
 *   - requiredFieldPaths   (empty — no explicit required evidence)
 *   - title                (placeholder, hand-curate later)
 *
 * What is INTENTIONALLY left empty (must be hand-authored):
 *   - demo                 (must be hand-curated synthetic fixture)
 *   - summaryLines         (must be authored for quick-check)
 *   - acceptance           (must list real anchors)
 *   - staleFallbacks       (only when evidence exists)
 *
 * Do NOT set `runtimeReady: true` or `profileStatus: "runtime-ready"`
 * on this file until demo, summaryLines, acceptance, and render
 * validation have been hand-authored.
